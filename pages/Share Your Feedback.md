description: Provide feedback on unjustified price increases of essential
  products and services that use the GST increase as a cover.
---
The CAP will investigate all allegations of unjustified price increases of essential products and services that use the Goods and Services Tax (GST) as a cover. 

If a business raises its prices, it is not acceptable for the business to use the GST increase as the reason for raising prices before the GST implementation, nor is it acceptable for a business to raise prices by more than the GST after the GST implementation, citing the GST as the reason.

If you come across a business that may have raised prices using the GST increase as a cover, raise the matter to the CAP. Help us identify errant businesses by providing us with detailed information through our feedback form. The CAP takes feedback on unjustified price increases of essential products and services that use the GST increase as a cover seriously.
